-  Given a set of movies and a file of people’s rating of the movies, the program could recommend movies that match 
 
Auto-Complete (C++)                                                                                                                             April 2017 
Individual coursework that completed the function of auto-complete by implementing a Ternary Search Tree in C++ 
- 
under Linux operating system 
-  Given a dictionary of words and their frequency, a prefix and a number of words wanted, the program will print a list 
of words that starts with the prefix and has the highest frequency.  
 
Game 2048 (Java)  
- 
-  Used GUI to realize the user interaction and personalize the game to be played in n*n size board instead of 4*4
