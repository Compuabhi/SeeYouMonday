          <h3>What is See U Monday?</h3>
          <p>See U Monday (SUM) is a personalized job searching tool where the results are tailored to individual users based on their resume. Using SUM, the user can upload a resume in pdf format. The data available from that input resume will be parsed through the text to identify userâ€™s skill set, and match the skill set with our documents that we have already built by crawling current top job searching tools such as Glassdoor and Indeed.</p>
